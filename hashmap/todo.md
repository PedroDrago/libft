- [ ] Resolve value free problem: When deleting node, it is not possible to know if key or value is malloced, therefore, freeing those variables may cause an Invalid Pointer exception and not freeing may cause Memory leaks. My current idea is very ugly but works, that is using flags, the User would set a flag to 0 if nothing must be freed, a flag to 1 if only value must be freed, a flag to 2 if only key must be freed and a flag to 3 if both must be freed. But this generate a problem in the hashmap interface: Every single node must be created in the same way, if one node malloced only the value 3 if both must be freed. But this generate a problem in the hashmap interface: Every single node must be created in the same way, if one node malloced only the value, all nodes must malloc only the value, and thats a rule for every situation. I don't like it because it overcomplicates the hashmap interface and use. Actually, after thinking  a litter, i could add a new field to the node structure, the flag itself, so the user must pass the flag when creating the node, and when deleting i can check the flags and operate based on that
