# To-do

- test if linked list functions still work.
- Implement itoa-base (almost done in printf).
- Update Readme documentation.
- Write short functions descriptions in header, so the LSP shows it.
- Make algorithms and data structures modules in subdirectories with their own headers, makefile etc: stack, queue, better linked list (singly and doubly), quick_sort, binary search.
- Try to make GNL in a single file
